# Public Directory

This `public` directory is used to store static assets such as images, icons, and other files that should be publicly accessible. To add a file, place it in this folder.

You can include assets like:
- Images (e.g., `.jpg`, `.png`, `.svg`)
- Fonts
- Favicons

Ensure that the file paths are correctly referenced in your application.
